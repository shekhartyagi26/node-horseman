# node-horseman
Horseman lets you run PhantomJS from Node.

Horseman has:
1) a simple chainable (Promise based) API,
2) an easy-to-use control flow (see the examples),
3) support for multiple tabs being open at the same time,
4) built in jQuery for easier page manipulation,
5) built in bluebird for easier in-browser async.
